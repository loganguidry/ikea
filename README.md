# Oh My, Ikea!
A game created by GROUP 6: Logan Guidry, Therese Henrikkson, and Jason Morris
---
A fire breaks out in your apartment. What do you save first? The dog, your kids? Hell no! You save your Swedish furniture.

Players take turns placing barriers to prevent the flames from reaching their oh-so-precious furniture. Each piece of furniture that doesn't get burnt to a crisp earns points for the player who placed it.

This entertaining party game was created for our Game Design & Development II course at Rochester Institute of Technology. Go Tigers!
